* Where possible, tests should be present, this includes unit, integration and end-to-end tests
* Test-driven development (TDD) is highly encouraged!
* At Bytecode, we aim to always achieve at least 80% of test coverage, preferably 90%+
* For all projects (even for HTML websites and WordPress themes), a CI-pipeline should be set up, to ensure the code compiles, there are no missing dependencies and there are no linting errors
* Always test your own code before sending your code to QA or requesting a merge-request review

# Nooijen Web Solutions Coding Standards
The coding standards for developers at Nooijen Web Solutions to ensure code health and quality of the products delivered to our clients.

## To do:

* Add all stuff from the current PDF file
* Add stuff from Asana to here as addition of the PDF
* Go more in depth to get some more info about certain js/css stuff
* Add default folder structure of a project
* Add the following files:
    * .eslintrc
    * .babelrc
    * .travis.yml
    * .gitignore
    * scss folder structure
* Add links to starter packs for MEAN, Node and HTML/Handlebars

## About
Please use these standards in every line of code you write. This is not to bully you but to make sure everyone in our company writes code the same way, and this is the only way to assure quality of our code.

This repo also contains files you can use for development. These files are *defaults*, so you can of course edit them to suit the needs of the project.

# General
There are some general rules that should be followed at all times.

* Work in a structured way! This is important to improve code quality and make it easier for your colleagues to work on the same project
* DRY! Don't repeat yourself! Don't build long functions for everything, but try to use smaller more modular (functional programming like) functions
* Use a clear folder structure, more on this in the *Git* section of this file
* Don't use "Yoda" conditions
* Always indent using 4 spaces, in all files. If you are using tabs, set your code editor to convert tabs to 4 spaces
* Lines should never exceed 150 characters (spaces included)
* For single line comments, use `// comment`, for multi-line comments, use `/** * comment */` styled comments in a Javadoc styled way
* Always document your code.
* Make sure your code is readable. This means using clear names for your functions, adding enough (although not too many) comments and adding enough and a consistent amount of whitespace
* Always use linters when you are writing code, and let the linter check your code before committing on Git
* Before working on a project, always discuss with the other developers on the approach and points you and your team should focus on

# Git

* Don't merge your own code into the develop/master branch, always create a pull request and let someone check the code

# Nooijen Web Solutions Coding Standards
The coding standards for developers at Nooijen Web Solutions to ensure code health and quality of the products delivered to our clients.

## To do:
* Add all stuff from the current PDF file
* Add stuff from Asana to here as addition of the PDF
* Go more in depth to get some more info about certain js/css stuff
* Add default folder structure of a project
* Add the following files:
    * .eslintrc
    * .babelrc
    * .travis.yml
    * .gitignore
    * scss folder structure
* Add links to starter packs for MEAN, Node and HTML/Handlebars

## About
Please use these standards in every line of code you write. This is not to bully you but to make sure everyone in our company writes code the same way, and this is the only way to assure quality of our code.

This repo also contains files you can use for development. These files are *defaults*, so you can of course edit them to suit the needs of the project.
